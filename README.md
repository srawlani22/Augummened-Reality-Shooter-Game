# Augummened-Reality-Shooter-Game


Wanna try making a shooter game with one of the most ingenious technology??
Try out making this AR game, it was refrenced from Mathew Hallberg's youtube channel and that guy has really has some serious cool stuff
down the lane.

In this game, The assests that I used were abstracted from a free 3dmodel website and I couldn't find that website now since I made this 
game almost two years ago and apologies for posting it late on git.

Check out this video below to see how the game looks:

PS: The environment is just my room.
